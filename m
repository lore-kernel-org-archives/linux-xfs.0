Hi all,

This is the eighth revision of a patchset that adds to XFS kernel
support for mapping multiple file logical blocks to the same physical
block (reflink/deduplication), implements the beginnings of online
metadata scrubbing and preening, and implements reverse mapping for
the realtime device.  There shouldn't be any incompatible on-disk
format changes, pending a thorough review of the patches within.

(NOTE: In the git trees, this series is preceded by the pending rmap
fixes patches posted to linux-xfs a few days ago.)

At the beginning of this series are imports of all the kernel patches
against libxfs/ that are needed to provide refcount btrees and reflink
support.  Please note that these patches /do/ have diffs against files
in the libxfs/ directory (mostly for deferred ops) that do not start
with 'xfs_', so the libxfs-apply script cannot be used in isolation.

After that are the various small changes required for db, growfs, io,
logprint, and manpages to support the new reference counting data
structures.  The mkfs patch is, as usual, at the end.

Before that, however, are a bunch of patches to xfs_repair that
spot-check the refcount btree and use the rmap tracking code
introduced in xfsprogs 4.8 to regenerate the refcount btree.  It also
fixes discrepancies in the inode reflink flag.

If you're going to start using this mess, you probably ought to just
pull from my github trees for kernel[1], xfsprogs[2], xfstests[3],
xfs-docs[4], and man-pages[5].  The kernel patches in the git trees
should apply to 4.8-rc3; xfsprogs patches to for-next; and xfstest to
master.

The patches have been xfstested with x64, ppc64, and armhf; all tests
in the clone and rmap groups pass.  AFAICT they don't cause any new
failures for the 'auto' group.

This is an extraordinary way to eat your data.  Enjoy! 
Comments and questions are, as always, welcome.
