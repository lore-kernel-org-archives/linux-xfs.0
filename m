Hi all,

This series hoists inode creation, renaming, and deletion operations to
libxfs in anticipation of the metadata inode directory feature, which
maintains a directory tree of metadata inodes.  This will be necessary
for further enhancements to the realtime feature, subvolume support.

There aren't supposed to be any functional changes in this intense
refactoring -- we just split the functions into pieces that are generic
and pieces that are specific to libxfs clients.  As a bonus, we can
remove various open-coded pieces of mkfs.xfs and xfs_repair when this
series gets to xfsprogs.

If you're going to start using this mess, you probably ought to just
pull from my git trees.  The kernel patches[1] should apply against
4.20.  xfsprogs[2] and xfstests[3] can be found in their usual
places.  The git trees contain all four series' worth of changes.

This is an extraordinary way to destroy everything.  Enjoy!
Comments and questions are, as always, welcome.
